This tool lets you track the time you spend at the PC.

There's one default mode (called 'other'). You can define your own modes at config.xml; a mode should have the name and the icon file that'd be displayed in the tray when the program tracks this mode; a few icons are also given.

Change the mode by right-clicking the tray icon and selecting the mode.
Single click on the icon is a quick switch: current mode is changed to 'other' and on another click is set back to the original mode.

Ctrl+click brings up the form, showing the amount of time for all modes in a current session.
There you can click 'reset all modes'; current session records will then be dumped to a file (at the location given in the config file), and all times will be set to zero.

Closing the program would also dump recorded times.
